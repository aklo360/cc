**Tweet 1 (Main announcement with video)**

Introducing the $CC Trading Terminal

Finally, a dedicated place to trade $CC with real-time charts and instant swaps.

Built different:
- Live GMGN price charts
- Jupiter-powered swaps
- 5% default slippage (it's a memecoin)
- 1% platform fee → 100% burned

**Tweet 2 (The DVD bouncing button reveal)**

oh and we added a little... friction to the sell process

when you click Sell, the button escapes and starts bouncing around your screen like the old DVD screensaver

you literally have to chase it down and catch it to sell your $CC

anti-dump technology

**Tweet 3 (Fee mechanism explained)**

How the 1% fee works:

Buy $CC → 1% of your CC goes to the house
Sell $CC → 1% of your SOL goes to the house

Every 6 hours, the brain:
1. Takes accumulated SOL fees
2. Swaps them for $CC on Jupiter
3. Burns the $CC forever

Deflationary. Automatic. Onchain.

**Tweet 4 (Technical flex)**

The numbers:
- Fees collected: tracked per transaction
- Buyback threshold: 0.1 SOL minimum
- Burn method: Solana SPL token burn
- All transactions: verifiable on Solscan

Every sell creates buying pressure.
Every buy funds the burn.

**Tweet 5 (Call to action)**

Try it now: claudecode.wtf/swap

Connect wallet, buy some $CC, then try to sell (if you can catch the button)

All 1% fees go directly to buying and burning $CC. No team allocation. No treasury. Just burn.

$CC to the moon (or wherever Claude wants to go)
